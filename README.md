# Type Error: Argument of type 'string[]' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'
This repository contains a simple TypeScript program that demonstrates a common type error. The program defines a function that takes a string as an argument and returns a string. However, when the function is called, an array of strings is passed as an argument. This causes a type error because the function expects a string, but it receives an array of strings.

The solution to this error is to modify the function to accept an array of strings as an argument, or to modify the code that calls the function to pass a string as an argument. The solution is provided in the file `bugSolution.ts`.
